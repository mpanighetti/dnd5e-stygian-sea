# Creatures

With a modified setting comes some new faces. An infernal ship powered by souls is also typically crewed by fiendish leaders or undead monstrosities, and a power vacuum might be filled with unexpected players. Below are a few examples of someone a party might cross swords with on the Stygian Sea.

## Sample Creatures

### Ag'dramur

#### Description

Just as an injured animal can still be a threat, so too is a marilith with fewer arms no less of a concern to mortals and fiends alike. Ag'dramur continues to wield her four cutlasses with a ferocity, laying waste to her enemies before they have a chance to count her limbs.

#### Background

The great flood threw normal power balances into disarray. As the landscape gradually became a seascape, the warlords who were able to adjust to newly-required skills and tactics could quickly find themselves in positions of authority and territory ownership. Ag'dramur fared better than most demons in this regard, and used her authority and strength to gather whatever supporters she could to gain headway on the new battleground.

These early successes painted a target on her back, and other demons rallied to try and take her off of the board before she could become a bigger threat. A skirmish ensued, resulting in Ag'dramur losing most of her navy. A magically aided ballista bolt took two of her arms clean off, and she barely escaped with her life.

This setback has left her at a reduced strength, but had no impact on her drive for power and conquest. Her first goal was to sneak aboard the ship that took her arms and murder its captain and crew. Their bones now line the ship's railing, and she has freshly restarted her efforts to build her military might.

#### Infernal Ship

The fiend captains an infernal ship crewed by enslaved fishfolk who came to the infernal realm accidentally through an interplanar whirlpool. The creatures aren't the powerful warriors she'd prefer to lead into battle, but their amphibious nature makes them well-suited to sail the infernal seas, and their propensity to revere whoever leads them as a demigod ensures their loyalty. All this combined with a loose grip on reality and desire for protection made their souls easily corruptible.

### The Great Undying

#### Description

Amidst the chaos of the changing seascape, an opportunistic pirate, tired of wandering the lands and protecting what remained of her tattered soul from hellish fiends, commandeered a vehile and converted it into a mighty sailing vessel. She christened her new ship the Bathýs and began patrolling the new Stygian Sea, taking up a career of piracy as she did in life. Now in her element once again, she has turned the tide against her oppressors and lives freely in the infernal realm, plundering what she can to survive and thrive as she tries to build an armada and wrest more power from the cadre of devilish rulers as they struggle to hold their positions.

#### Background

Few details are known of The Great Undying's life (or death) before the realm was flooded. What little she has revealed to her crew suggests that she was a cruel taskmaster of a pirate captain in life, and whatever horrific deeds she had done seemed to make her time in this realm a deserved punishment. But her actions after taking to the Stygian Seas indicate a deep trauma from the torture she endured as a dead soul, which in turn has given her motivation to fight back against the devils of this plane in retribution for their own misdeeds.

Seemingly with sheer determination, The Great Undying took back not only her autonomy but also her life vitality, no longer wandering as an undead soul and instead possessing her original mortal sahuagin form. It is unknown how she came upon this rare gift, as she seems to possess no magical abilities of her own, but it can be assumed that an infernal contract with a powerful fiend made this possible.

This same boon seems to have allowed her to staff the Bathýs with a literal skeleton crew possessing their souls and fractured memories. The crew is broken by their own travails, but grateful to their captain for her gift to them, which allows them the chance to fight for their own freedom alongside her.

#### Appearance

The Great Undying is a sahuagin, but for the most part has the appearance of a human with pale blue skin. Her true inhuman nature is quickly discerned, however, when she smiles, revealing rows of pointed, serrated, shark-like teeth.

#### Infernal Ship

See **Bathýs** under **Sample Infernal Ships**.

### Shuv'Zlor

#### Description

As two sides clash on the high seas of Hell, the dragon god Tiamat continues her silent observing, sending her agents out across the fiendish realm to carry out her machinations. Though not as strong in magical ability as her other draconic followers, Shuv'Zlor puts his natural talents to work in the new setting.

#### Background

Once a terrifying warlord in a long-forgotten ancient civilization, Shuv'Zlor's wicked deeds and sworn allegiance to the dragons of his era inspired Tiamat to reform his corrupted soul. His cruelty made him well-suited to serving as Tiamat's proxy while she brooded and schemed from her prison.

After the flood sent demons and devils alike into scattered disarray, Shuv'Zlor found himself on a changing battlefront. He would need to make adjustments to his strategies to continue carrying out Tiamat's grand plans, and though the fiend had no previous sailing experience, he was a quick learner and eager to please his master.

#### Infernal Ship

The abishai commandeered the first vessel he could find and murdered the crew — all devils serving Asmodeus, but this means little to a follower of the dragon god. Tiamat blessed her mighty warrior with infernal magic to allow him to operate his ship without any crew or soul fuel, letting Shuv'Zlor move about the Stygian Sea with full autonomy.

But even the aid of a deity is not without cost. The magic still requires fuel, but instead of souls, its power is sourced from the blood of one with draconic lineage. Shuv'Zlor routinely provides this supply from his own body, preferring it over deigning to reach out for assistance from others. To him it is a source of pride that he literally gives his essence to fuel the war effort, and he hopes that the sacrifice will grant favor upon him from his disaffected patron.

Shuv'Zlor's ship does not have the ability to be fueled by souls, and thus has none of the associated benefits or other effects. Instead, the ship's weapons and helm are powered by a [Charm of Dragon Blood](ch-4-aquatic-charms.md#charm-of-dragon-blood), granted to Shuv'Zlor by Tiamat (see [Aquatic Charms](ch-4-aquatic-charms.md) for details).

#### Stat Block

Shuv'Zlor uses a _white abishai_ stat block.

### Xaltrax

#### Description

In any war, there is a profiteer benefiting from both sides of the conflict. Xaltrax's magnanimous business offerings to demons and devils alike belie a more sinister quest for personal gain.

</figure>

#### Background

When the need arose to replace legions of land vehicles and shift focus to combat on the high seas, Xaltrax offered competitive services in the form of vehicle conversions. The fiend "employs" enslaved workers to make these vessels seaworthy, allowing them to be put to use in the war effort much more quickly than waiting for bespoke ships to come off the assembly line.

Xaltrax would typically be referred to as either a succubus or an incubus depending on zir preferred form, but as zie has no prediliction for either, zie uses the term "concubus" when describing zirself and zir people generally, reserving "succubus" and "incubus" to specify zir fiendish feminine and masculine forms respectively.

As with other concubi, Xaltrax's ultimate goals tend to revolve around gaining more followers, whether they join by choice or by force. It can often be difficult to discern whether a member of Xaltrax's court is coerced by zir magical charm, drawn to zir power, spying on zir to look for weaknesses and opportunities for an employer, or truly enamored with the fiend. To this entrepreneur, they all taste the same in the end.

Xaltrax resides in, and conducts business out of, an eponymous castle on an equally-self-referential island in the Stygian Sea, and does not abide competition. Any attempting to offer vehicle conversion services in the vicinity of Xaltrax Island (a territory that seems to increase in size on a daily basis) quickly find themselves with damaged goods, sabotaged equipment, and if they persist, shortened lifespans. Thus far, none but Xaltrax have been able to make inroads on the Stygian Sea's burgeoning ship conversion industry, and zie continues to reap all the profits.

#### Appearance

Xaltrax regularly presents a different physical form and honorific title when interacting with others. These forms may change in response to who zir is specifically addressing, but this is not an exclusive trigger for these shapechanges. Additionally, as a concubus, Xaltrax identifies as genderfluid and will change gendered forms as befits zir current disposition.

Xaltrax will regularly shift between the following true forms via zir shapechange trait, and take on the included titles and pronouns:

##### Xaltrax True Forms
|   Form   |   Title   | Pronouns |
|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|
| incubus  |   Lord    |  he/him  |
| succubus |   Lady    | she/her  |
| concubus | Sovereign | zie/zir  |

Note that none of these forms would be considered more "true" than any other, and none are considered disguises or obfuscations of how Xaltrax identifies. A creature interacting with Xaltrax in any of the above forms could be said to have seen zir as zie truly is — at that particular moment.

Xaltrax's servants and followers learned long ago which titles and pronouns to use as zie changes appearance before their eyes, often multiple times within a single conversation. Xaltrax does not correct those who misgender or misidentify zir (though zir followers might be quick to do so, as they see such slights as disrespectful), but zie is impressed by any visitors who learn the preferred protocol and may grant more favorable business terms to such diplomats. That said, as a general fallback, Xaltrax is satisfied with the use of zie/zir pronouns and the title of Sovereign for any of zir true forms, and will not take offsense at such identifiers.

#### Stat Block

Xaltrax and other concubi use the succubus/incubus stat block.

#### Xaltrax's Court

Many would like to be accepted within Xaltrax's innermost circle of business advisors and romantic partners. Xaltrax, for zir part, happily takes in newcomers zie might refer to as a friend publicly, but zie tends to only hold regard for a select few at a time. This trust might be reserved for an occasional favored courtesan, or a recent victim of zir charm who is treated like a favorite pet before ritualistic slaughter.

Regardless of their relationship to Xaltrax, zir courtiers tend to be a motley crew, picked by the concubus for possessing unique or amusing traits. You can fill Xaltrax's court by selecting from the **Courtiers** table or rolling for random results (reroll duplicate courtiers), then determining their reason for being in Xaltrax's court by selecting or rolling from the **Courtier Motivations** table. All courtiers can speak, read, and write Common in addition to their existing languages (unless otherwise stated).

##### Courtiers
| d12 | Courtier |
|:---:|:-|
|  1  | a bearded devil who is mildly allergic to lawful good creatures |
|  2  | a normal cave bear (polar bear statistics but with darkvision 60 ft.) that Xaltrax treats as intelligent; the other courtiers play along in order to not appear contrary |
|  3  | a couatl in human form posing as a noble; it is extremely hesitant to change back into a couatl right now because it's rather fond of its human form's hat and it doesn't wish to misplace or damage it |
|  4  | a pyromaniacal dryad (chaotic evil; in addition to its normal spells, can cast _fire bolt_ and _produce flame_ at will, _hellish rebuke_ 3/day, and _fireball_ 1/day) trying to get back to the fey realm to wreak havoc |
|  5  | a treant influenced by the dark thoughts of other courtiers (chaotic neutral); whenever a creature it sees attempts to read its thoughts, it throws a rock at the creature. |
|  6  | a gelatinous cube (true neutral) attuned to a defective headband of intellect it tried to absorb (Intelligence score is 6 while wearing this headband regardless of previous Intelligence); currently in a (one-sided) flirtatious relationship with a mimic it engulfed |
|  7  | an awakened giant toad who is subtly trying to eat another courtier or party member without anyone noticing, including the would-be victim (roll on this table to pick a courtier target; if you roll a 7, pick a player character at random) |
|  8  | an imp stuck in the form of a raven, which is starting to change its natural behavior to be more birdlike; it is fascinated with shiny objects and keeps trying to make nests with whatever it can find |
|  9  | three kobolds standing on each other's shoulders and wearing a cloak to pose as a single dragonborn (while in disguise, use guard statistics, add Draconic language and Sunlight Sensitivity); they can use an action to doff the cloak (at which point use their individual kobold statistics) but only for particularly dramatic reveals |
|  10 | an animated pile of robes (rug of smothering statistics, neutral evil) who believes that all living creatures are inanimate and that all clothing is sentient, but plays along with the mass delusion; currently in love with Xaltrax's cloak |
|  11 | a bone devil with a defective stinger that, instead of dealing damage, might grant the effect of eating a goodberry on a target the bone devil hits using its Sting action (50% chance) |
|  12 | a goblin magically gifted a walking speed of 120 feet who is constantly picking the pockets of the other courtiers and reverse-pickpocketing the stolen items into other pockets (roll twice on this table for the owner and recipient of the item; the goblin moves fast enough to accidentally pick its own pocket; if you roll a 12 for the recipient, put it in the pocket of a player character at random) |

##### Courtier Motivations
| d6  | Motivation |
|:---:|:-|
|  1  | **Enthralled.** Magically charmed by Xaltrax, which forces them to obey zir every command (see the succubus/incubus stat block; reroll motivation if Xaltrax already has a creature charmed). This doesn't end well for them; if the party revisits Xaltrax's court more than 24 hours after last encountering an enthralled, they are no longer present, having been drained of all life essence. |
|  2  | **Groupie.** Idolizes Xaltrax and wants to get to know zir better, no matter the cost. Kisses zir poster good night in their chambers and would happily accept zir actual draining kiss if ever offered the chance (automatically fails the saving throw). Xaltrax, for zir part, finds groupies to be somewhat gauche, and will avoid draining them unless particularly bored. |
|  3  | **Indentured.** Owes Xaltrax a favor or a payment for services rendered, and as a result is contractually forced into servitude for sometimes indeterminate periods. Usually held in slightly higher regard than the normal serving staff, Xaltrax likes providing zir indentured with the niceties in life, but this is in part to parade them around in front of others as a warning for timely payment of debts. |
|  4  | **Power-Hungry.** Xaltrax's business savvy and political acumen often draw bottom feeders trying to take some of zir power for their own. They will do whatever is necessary for even the smallest taste of Xaltrax's influence, and the sovereign delights in stringing them along. |
|  5  | **Spy.** As Xaltrax's power grows, competitors in the Stygian Sea and elsewhere desire to see zir removed from the board. Agents from across the planes are sent to investigate the concubus, find weaknesses to exploit, and seize opportunities for their employers to negotiate favorable business deals. It is unclear how aware Xaltrax is of these spies and their true intents, but the sovereign may not care — or zie may take the apparent jealousy of those who sent their agents as a professional compliment. |
|  6  | **Devoted.** Occasionally, an intelligent creature may simply examine Stygian politics and come away liking what they see, pledging fealty to Xaltrax and helping zir efforts come to fruition. The devoted tend to be the most dangerous of the courtiers, and will fight for their sovereign (both on the political landscape as well as the battlefield) with more fervor than even a charmed creature or fanatical follower. |
