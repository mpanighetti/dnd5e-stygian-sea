# Chapter 2: Infernal Ships

## Creating an infernal ship

The easiest approach when designing your own infernal ship is to start with a vehicle with features you like (either a ship or a land-based vehicle), then pull in features from the opposite vehicle type onto your template. You might find they go together like chocolate and peanut butter (which sadly is revolting in Avernus like all other food, but maybe you'll have better luck).

At minimum, the following modifications are required for turning a ship or land vehicle into an infernal ship:

### Converting a ship

Giving a ship the attributes of an infernal ship requires at least the following changes:

- _**Add an immunity to fire damage and remove any immunity to exhaustion.**_ Infernal ships are typically made of infernal iron (if your ship is still made of wood, omit this change). However, their dependency on souls for power may make them vulnerable to exhaustion under certain conditions.

- _**Add a soul fuel propulsion method.**_ The Stygian Sea, being a new body of water, has unpredictable air currents, to the point where finding a favorable wind is often impossible. To work around this, an infernal ship typically contains a method of propulsion fueled by souls to allow for magical movement across the sea. See **Stygian Water Propulsion** for guidance.

- _**Add the Magic Weapons trait.**_ All infernal war machines use magical weapons to counter the increased strength and resilience of demons and devils, and infernal ships are no exception.

### Converting a land vehicle

Giving a land vehicle the attributes of a ship is a little more involved (for obvious reasons). The following changes are recommended at minimum:

- _**Add Ship Actions.**_ Determine how many actions your infernal ship can take on its turn, and pick crew member count thresholds under which the action count would be reduced. Also, some larger ships might not provide cover for a ship action if a helm or weapon is on its exposed deck.

- _**Add one or more ranged weapons.**_ Combat on the water typically requires firing weapons to weaken an enemy ship from a distance, then coming in closer to board. The most common ranged weapon a ship might use is a ballista or cannon, but other similar weapons can be used.

  Some ship weapons might require multiple actions from different creatures to fire, including loading and aiming. This is not compatible with water-based combat, where weapons tend to only require a single ship action. In these cases, consider removing the separate actions but instead adding a recharge roll (similar to some monster actions). This still provides some realism (and reduced damage output) while allowing for streamlined combat.

- _**Add a means of stygian water propulsion.**_ The wheels of a land vehicle might be practical on land, but useless in the water. Instead, most ships travel the sea with a sail on a mast or oars (or both). But since it would be a shame to lose the ride-or-die imagery an infernal vehicle might convey, the vehicle's propulsion method should still be fueled by souls. See **Stygian Water Propulsion** for suggestions; you can use control and movement components from existing ships of a similar size to your infernal ship.

- _**Remove or reduce land movement speed.**_ Since land vehicles usually need their wheels removed or rendered nonfunctional to work on the water, their original movement speed attribute is no longer applicable. Use the speed of any water propulsion methods you've added instead (e.g. sail, oars, motor, engine).

  As an exception to removing land speed entirely, if you've made your infernal ship amphibious and retained its wheels, consider reducing its land speed by half. A vehicle with these sorts of modifications is going to have reduced maneuverability on land.

- _**Remove or change incompatible features and traits.**_ As an example, a land vehicle with a trait dependent on jumping over a gap in the road might not make much sense on the water. Consider removing such features and traits, or modifying them to work on the sea (see the **skate** vehicle stat block for an example replacement trait for a similar vehicle). Try to maintain the flavor of the original vehicle when redesigning these traits or features.

### Stygian Water Propulsion

The **Stygian Water Propulsion Examples** table includes several types of propulsion an infernal ship might use in the unpredictable waters of the Stygian Sea. Mechanical propulsion methods are powered by the magical energy provided by souls, as traditional methods of water transportation may be too slow or inefficient for hellish high-seas combat and survival.

Pick a propulsion type suitable to your vehicle's size class. Smaller infernal ships might use their soul fuel to power a propeller, allowing them to quickly zip around and outmaneuver an enemy. Larger vessels might use a gigantic fuel source that can burn more souls at once to power a large paddle wheel, allowing travel over long stretches of open sea.

If you're creating your own method of water propulsion, consider what real-world sea vehicles match the intended use case of your infernal ship and design your propulsion method around that.

If you wish to make one of the propulsion types be powered by souls, you could grant it a magical upgrade appropriate to the propulsion method. Note that the upgrade only has its effect if the infernal ship is actively consuming souls for fuel, unless the ship was given this upgrade on the Material Plane using another fuel source.

Souls are not required for some methods of propulsion, but without this reliable source of power, your infernal ship may have trouble getting around in the Stygian Sea, and will potentially suffer an additional effect as indicated by its **Mundane Penalty**.

Note that this is not a comprehensive list and you should feel free to come up with your own creative solutions. Additionally, the size class recommendations are only that; choose whatever feels suitable for your particular infernal ship and scale it appropriately.

#### Soul Coin Charge Cost

Most infernal ships require consuming one soul for every 24 hours of travel. Gargantuan vehicles, however, require consuming two souls for the same benefit.

##### Stygian Water Propulsion Examples
| Propulsion Type | Sizes | Upgrade | Mundane Penalty | Note |
|:----------------|:-----:|:---------------------:|:---------------:|:----:|
| Oars            |  all  | automatic oars | once per hour of travel, roll percentile dice; 50% chance of rowers suffering one point of exhaustion |
| Paddle Wheel    | Huge – Gargantuan | none | none | soul fuel required |
| Propeller       | Large – Huge | none | none | soul fuel required |
| Sails           | Medium – Gargantuan | sails always full of wind | once per hour of travel, roll percentile dice; 60% chance of no wind, 20% chance of opposing wind |

## Infernal Ship Stat Blocks

This section describes how infernal ships reconcile their mundane origins with traversing the Stygian Sea, as well as newly introduced concepts unique to infernal ships.

### Actions and Components

An infernal ship has the same default action options and components as a normal ship.

### Basic Statistics

By default, infernal ships match the statistics of normal seafaring ships, except for the following:

#### Size

Like normal ships, most infernal ships are Large, Huge, or Gargantuan.

A Medium or smaller infernal ship is unusual but not impossible. Tiny creatures like imps or sprites might drive miniature ships made of discarded scraps of infernal iron, using their smaller size to their advantage to sneak past enemy defenses and act as spies. Note that their water propulsion method options are usually limited to oars as noted in the **Stygian Water Propulsion Examples** table, but at that size they could also be propelled forward by a creature's own magical abilities.

#### Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities

An infernal ship's vulnerabilities, resistances, and immunities apply to all its components, unless otherwise noted in the stat block.

Infernal ships are typically immune to fire, poison, and psychic damage. They are also usually immune to the following conditions: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, stunned, and unconscious. Additionally, Huge and Gargantuan infernal ships tend to be immune to the incapacitated and prone conditions.

Note that infernal ships powered by souls have no immunity to exhaustion, as infernal vehicles are potentially susceptible to exhaustion effects under certain conditions. Also, a ship that is not immune to the prone condition should have the Prone Deficiency trait (if the vehicle falls prone, it can't right itself and is incapacitated until pulled upright), unless it has something in its design that specifically overcomes this weakness.

## Sample Infernal Ships

### [Bathýs](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/vehicles/bathys.md)

#### Description

If one squints, the Bathýs superficially resembles a sailing vessel one might see on the oceans of the Material Plane, but a closer examination reveals the vessel to be mechanical in design and built of a dark infernal iron. Its hull is assembled from scraps of motorized land vehicles, with large metal beams twisted into tight braids in the vague shape of a ship, but pulsing with the churning of gears and an infusion of chaotic magical energy that provides buoyancy.

The Bathýs accounts for the Stygian Sea's lack of predicable winds with an enchanted sail that allows for movement in still or opposing winds. To power this magic, a furnace in the belly of the ship fuels the mast and sails with the energy of consumed souls.

The Bathýs employs several exotic armaments, some stolen from other vessels, others repurposed from siege weaponry. The cannon on its port side provides a range and firepower not typically seen in seafaring combat, and the harpoon launcher to starboard allows for a quick method of trapping other ships for boarding and plundering.

#### Crew

The Bathýs is captained by **The Great Undying**, a sahuagin pirate in life who continued her piratical reign of terror on the hellish Stygian Sea.

Besides its captain, the ship is crewed entirely by reanimated skeletons. Magically gifted with speech and independent thought, the crew is nonetheless loyal to its captain — or too fearful of her wrath to protest.

Unlike normal skeletons, the crew of the Bathýs has had their souls, intellect, and autonomy restored, along with some of their memories from when they were living creatures. They are still obedient and faithful to The Great Undying, but this is less a compulsion of necromantic spellbinding and more out of gratitude for her taking pity on their damned souls. They can question their captain's orders but will follow them obediently unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise. They can speak and read Common, Infernal, and Abyssal, allowing them to interact with the denizens of the infernal realm without difficulty.

The exception to this restoration of the soul is "Brutus", a minotaur skeleton crew member. It was animated in the more typical necromantic fashion and behaves normally (for a minotaur skeleton, anyway). Its true name is unknown as only its bones were reanimated, leaving it a mindless and obedient servant of The Great Undying and her crew.

Beyond the captain, there are no other designated officers on the ship. Instead, members of the "skeleton crew" fulfill these roles interchangeably as needed. Brutus acts as muscle to help defend the ship from hostile takeover but is otherwise kept below decks for the general safety of the crew.

#### Layout

- The Bathýs has an **infernal cannon** and 5 cannon balls on the main deck, with additional cannon balls secured in the siege weapon ammunition cabin.
- The **harpoon launcher** is on the main deck, containing one harpoon attached to the deck with a chain of infernal iron.
- The ship has one 80-foot-tall mast with a sail.
- There are no rowboats, oars, or benches.
- All wooden or iron objects and structures typical for a ship are made of infernal iron. The ship's doors and footlockers have AC 20, 18 hit points, and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage.
- The hanging lanterns are under the effect of a _continual flame_ spell, with the following changes:
  - The lanterns cast dim light in a 20-foot radius.
  - The flame from these lanterns is not affected by the _darkness_ spell and ignores its effect within the light's radius.
- There is no privy.
- The medical cabin has been repurposed to hold the captain's private treasure storage, including the ship's main supply of soul coins. The door to this cabin is usually locked, the key kept by the captain.

_**Cannon Ball (Recharge 5-6).** Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, range 600/2,400 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage.

### [Skate](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/vehicles/skate.md)

#### Description

With its lack of weaponry, this boat is seemingly not a major threat to larger vessels of war. That impression fades quickly, however, as a skate can catch its foes by surprise with its speed and maneuverability, allowing it to nimbly dodge enemy fire and close in on its prey. Small fleets of skates can bring down a ship quickly by swarming and surrounding it, then boarding it to take out the crew in close-quarters combat rather than trying to overpower their siege weapons.

The skate achieves this impressive maneuverability by using souls to power a small propeller at the rear of the vehicle. With sufficient power, a skate can run circles around sail-powered vessels in any wind conditions. It's built like a motorcycle, but its wheels have been replaced with long flat metal beams, allowing it to quickly glide across the water.

#### Attributes

_Large vehicle (10 ft. by 5 ft.)_

- **Creature Capacity:** 1 crew, 2 passengers holding onto the outside of the hull
- **Cargo Capacity:** 100 lb.
- **Travel Pace:** 5 miles per hour (120 miles per day)

|  STR  |  DEX  |  CON  |  INT  |  WIS  |  CHA  |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|14 (+2)|18 (+4)|12 (+1)|0|0|0|

- **Immunities:** Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Fire, Frightened, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poison, Psychic, Stunned, Unconscious

#### Traits

_**Juke**_. If the skate is able to move, the crew can use its reaction to grant the skate advantage on a Dexterity saving throw.

_**Prone Deficiency.**_ If the skate falls prone, it can't right itself and is incapacitated until pulled upright.

#### Actions

On its turn, the skate can take the move action. It can't take this action if it has no crew.

**Move.** The ship can use its helm to move with its propeller.

#### Hull

- **Armor Class:** 23 (19 while motionless)
- **Hit Points:** 30 (damage threshold 5, mishap threshold 10)

#### Control: Helm

- **Armor Class:** 20
- **Hit Points:** 10

Move up to the speed of the ship's propeller. If the helm is destroyed, the ship can't turn and must use all of its movement speed on its turn, moving in a straight line in the same direction it last moved (this happens even if there is no crew).

#### Movement: Propeller

- **Armor Class:** 15
- **Hit Points:** 30; -40 ft. speed per 10 damage taken
- **Speed (water):** 120 ft.

_**Rev Motor.**_ If the skate moves at least 60 feet on its turn, it does not provoke opportunity attacks.
