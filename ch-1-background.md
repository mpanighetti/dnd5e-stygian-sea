# Chapter 1: Background

As the Blood War raged between devils and demons on the battle-scorched plains of Avernus, a group of enterprising fiends sought to access the Material Plane to wreak havoc upon its denizens. With a great sacrifice of souls and mortal blood, they were able to perform an arcane ritual which opened a great portal, large enough for their legions of troops to march upon the lands of the living.

Unfortunately, they did not anticipate the need for specificity in their incantations. A miscalculation in the spell caused the portal to open at the bottom of the world's oceans, resulting in a massive torrent of seawater wiping out the entirety of the invading force. The ensuing chaos interrupted the demonic casters, which prevented them from being able to close the portal before they were washed away.

The hellish landscape changed overnight. The River Styx flooded, causing temporary bouts of memory loss to nearby residents before it became diluted and lost much of its potency. Gorges and canyons disappeared in the waves. Once-mighty mountains became tiny islands. The water continued to rise in the following weeks, and soon the landscape was a massive unnatural ocean. The entire ecosystem was thrown into sharp disarray, grinding the war effort to a stop.

But devils and demons are nothing if not enterprising and adaptive. Over the coming months, orders began to pour into the forges for vehicles better suited to travel and combat on water. Soon the new Stygian Sea was teeming with naval fleets, and the war carried on, still fueled by souls but now being waged on the decks of infernal ships.
